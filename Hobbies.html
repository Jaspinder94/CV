    <p style="font-size:20px">My hobbies are reading books and working out. Along with this, I also like painting and taking
      a good care of plants.I usually spend my leisure time reading books or playing badminton.
      I like reading new and trending novels and my favourite genres include suspense, horror
      and thriller novels. Being a voracious reader, I believe that I have a strong vocabulary
      and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from my passion for reading books.
      I like participating in volunteer activities especially teaching underprivileged kids.
      I have been associated with a few non-profit organisations since my college days and
      I like spending my weekends helping these NGOs for different activities from teaching to
      organising interesting games and activities to make learning fun for kids.
