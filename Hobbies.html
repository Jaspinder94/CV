        <dt>Writing</dt>
        <dd>Being a voracious reader, I believe that I have a strong vocabulary
        and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from my passion for reading books.</dd>
        <dt>Reading Books</dt>
        <dd>My hobby is reading books.I usually spend my leisure time reading books.I like reading new and trending novels
          and my favourite genres include suspense, horror and thriller novels. </dd>
        <dt>Teaching</dt>
        <dd>I like participating in volunteer activities especially teaching underprivileged kids.
        I have been associated with a few non-profit organisations since my college days and
        I like spending my weekends helping these NGOs for different activities from teaching to
        organising interesting games and activities to make learning fun for kids.</dd>
